# Mapping Document Authoring

Guide users through creating a schema-valid Gemara `#MappingDocument` artifact that connects two existing security artifacts.

## Tools and Resources

| Tool / Resource | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `validate_gemara_artifact` | Validate YAML against a Gemara CUE schema definition |
| `migrate_gemara_artifact` | Migrate v0 artifacts to v1 schema |
| `gemara://lexicon` | Term definitions for the Gemara security model |
| `gemara://schema/definitions` | CUE schema definitions for all artifact types |

## Prerequisite Check

Before starting the authoring flow, check that the user has two artifacts to map between.

### Step 1: Scan the repo

Search for `.yaml` and `.yml` files containing a `metadata.type` field with a recognized Gemara artifact type. Build an inventory table:

| Layer | Artifact Type | Found | File |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| 1 | GuidanceCatalog | | |
| 2 | ThreatCatalog | | |
| 2 | ControlCatalog | | |
| 2 | CapabilityCatalog | | |
| 3 | RiskCatalog | | |
| 3 | Policy | | |
| 3 | MappingDocument | | |

### Step 2: Check prerequisites

A MappingDocument requires **two existing artifacts** to map between (source and target). These can be Gemara artifacts from the repo, external references (e.g., NIST 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK), or artifacts provided by the user.

If fewer than two Gemara artifacts are found in the repo:

> "A Mapping Document connects two artifacts. I found [count] Gemara artifact(s) in this repo. You can proceed if you have external references or can provide artifacts by URL or pasted content. What would you like to do?"
>
> 1. Provide artifacts by URL, file path, or pasted content
> 2. Build the prerequisite artifacts first (recommend ThreatCatalog or ControlCatalog)
> 3. Choose a different artifact type

### Step 3: Proceed to authoring

Once two artifacts are confirmed, proceed to the authoring flow below.

---

## Authoring Flow

Before beginning, read the `gemara://lexicon` and `gemara://schema/definitions` resources for terminology and schema awareness.

You suggest structure, propose mappings, and draft content — but every mapping, relationship, and reference requires explicit user approval before inclusion. The user owns the artifact; you are the guide.

> **Note:** The `#MappingDocument` schema is currently marked as **experimental** in the Gemara specification. The structure may change in future versions. Validate your artifact against the latest schema before production use.

### Outline

Goal: Produce a valid Gemara `#MappingDocument` YAML artifact through interactive, user-approved steps — covering metadata, source and target artifact references, individual entry mappings with relationship types, and schema validation.

Execution steps:

1. **Artifact Import** — Identify the **source artifact** and **target artifact** that this mapping document will connect.

   Ask the user to provide both artifacts (by URL, file path, or pasted YAML content). For each artifact:

   - Run the artifact type identification procedure (see below) to confirm its type.
   - Run the version check procedure (see below) to detect v0 artifacts and prompt for migration.
   - Record the artifact's `metadata.id`, `metadata.type`, title, version, URL, and description for the `mapping-references` field. Use the artifact's actual `gemara-version` (e.g., `"0.20.0"`) as the `version` in the `mapping-references` entry — do not override it with the mapping document's own version.

   Valid Gemara artifact types that can participate in mappings:

   | Artifact Type     | Entry Types Available                          |
   |-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | ControlCatalog    | Control, AssessmentRequirement                 |
   | ThreatCatalog     | Threat                                         |
   | CapabilityCatalog | Capability                                     |
   | GuidanceCatalog   | Guideline, Statement                           |
   | VectorCatalog     | Vector                                         |

   Non-Gemara artifacts (e.g., NIST 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK, ISO 27001) can also be referenced as mapping targets. For these, ask the user to specify:
   - A short identifier (e.g., `NIST-800-53`)
   - Title, version, URL, and description
   - The entry-type that best describes the atomic units (e.g., `"Guideline"` for framework controls, `"Statement"` for policy statements)

2. **Scope and Metadata** — Confirm scope with the user, then generate the metadata block using the artifacts from step 1.

   Ask the user for:
   1. The component name and ID prefix (ORG.PROJECT.COMPONENT format, e.g., 'ACME.PLAT.GW').
   2. A title for the mapping document (e.g., "Control-to-Threat Mapping for {component}").
   3. A short description of what this mapping captures.
   4. Author name and identifier.

   **URL rules for `mapping-references`:**
   - **Bundle-local** references (artifacts that live in the same repository/bundle) SHOULD use relative `file://` URLs (e.g. `url: file://../catalogs/my-catalog.yaml`). The assembler needs a URL to fetch dependencies into the bundle — without one, the dependency is silently skipped and the bundle ships incomplete.
   - **External** references (public frameworks, upstream catalogs hosted at a URL) SHOULD include `url` with `https://`.

   Generate the metadata YAML block:

   ```yaml
   title: {from user}
   metadata:
     id: {ID_PREFIX from user}
     type: MappingDocument
     gemara-version: "v1.3.0"
     description: {from user}
     version: 1.0.0
     author:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: Software Assisted
     mapping-references:
       - id: {source artifact id}
         title: {source artifact title}
         version: {source artifact version}
         url: {source artifact URL}
         description: {source artifact description}
       - id: {target artifact id}
         title: {target artifact title}
         version: {target artifact version}
         url: {target artifact URL}
         description: {target artifact description}
   ```

   All `reference-id` values used in step 3 and step 4 must correspond to an entry declared in `mapping-references`.

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#MappingDocument`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

3. **Configure Mapping Direction** — Define the source-reference and target-reference.

   Using the artifacts confirmed in step 1, set:

   - **source-reference**: The artifact being mapped FROM. Its `reference-id` must match a `mapping-references` entry. Ask the user to confirm the `entry-type` — the type of atomic units in the source artifact (e.g., `"Control"`, `"Threat"`, `"Capability"`).
   - **target-reference**: The artifact being mapped TO. Same rules apply.

   Present the proposed direction for approval:

   | Direction | Artifact              | Reference ID | Entry Type |
   |-----------|-----------------------|--------------|------------|
   | Source    | {source artifact}     | {id}         | {type}     |
   | Target    | {target artifact}     | {id}         | {type}     |

   Reply "yes" to confirm, or suggest changes.

   ```yaml
   source-reference:
     reference-id: {source mapping-reference id}
     entry-type: {source entry type}

   target-reference:
     reference-id: {target mapping-reference id}
     entry-type: {target entry type}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#MappingDocument`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

4. **Define Mappings** — For each entry in the source artifact, define its relationship to entries in the target artifact.

   For each source entry, work through these sub-steps sequentially. Present each for approval before moving to the next.

   a. **Source entry**: Identify the source entry by its `entry-id` (e.g., a control ID, threat ID, etc.).

   b. **Mapping ID**: Use pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.MAP##` (e.g., `{ID_PREFIX}.MAP01`).

   c. **Relationship type**: Propose a relationship type and present for confirmation:

      | Relationship   | Meaning                                                     |
      |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
      | implements     | Source fulfills the target's objective                       |
      | implemented-by | Target fulfills the source's objective                      |
      | supports       | Source contributes to, but does not fully satisfy, the target|
      | supported-by   | Target contributes to, but does not fully satisfy, the source|
      | equivalent     | Source and target express the same intent                   |
      | subsumes       | Source fully contains the target's scope and more           |
      | no-match       | Source has no counterpart in the target artifact            |
      | relates-to     | Related but the nature is unspecified                       |

   d. **Target entries** (skip if relationship is `no-match`): Propose relevant target entries in a table:

      |   | Target Entry ID | Title     | Relationship | Strength | Confidence | Rationale |
      |---|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|
      | a | {entry id}      | {title}   | {type}       | {1-10}   | {level}    | {why}     |
      | b | {entry id}      | {title}   | {type}       | {1-10}   | {level}    | {why}     |

      - **Strength** (optional): 1-10 scale estimating how completely the source satisfies the target.
      - **Confidence level** (optional): `Undetermined`, `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`.
      - **Rationale** (optional): Explains why this relationship exists.

      Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep (e.g., "a, b"), modify, or reject.

   Once all sub-steps are confirmed for a mapping, generate the mapping YAML block:

   ```yaml
   mappings:
     - id: {ID_PREFIX}.MAP##
       source: {source entry-id}
       relationship: {relationship type}
       targets:
         - entry-id: {target entry-id}
           strength: {1-10, optional}
           confidence-level: {level, optional}
           rationale: {text, optional}
       remarks: {optional}
   ```

   For `no-match` relationships:

   ```yaml
   mappings:
     - id: {ID_PREFIX}.MAP##
       source: {source entry-id}
       relationship: no-match
       remarks: {explanation of why no match exists}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#MappingDocument`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

5. **Assemble and Validate** — Combine all steps into the complete MappingDocument YAML document.

   - Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the full YAML (definition: `#MappingDocument`).
   - Present the final YAML followed by a validation report:

     | Field   | Result                   |
     |---------|--------------------------|
     | Schema  | #MappingDocument         |
     | Valid   | true/false               |
     | Message | message from tool output |
     | Errors  | count, or "None"         |

   - If errors exist, diagnose the specific issue, propose corrected YAML, and re-validate.
   - On success, provide local validation instructions:

     ```bash
     go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
     cue vet -c -d '#MappingDocument' github.com/gemaraproj/gemara@v1 mapping.yaml
     ```

6. **Next Steps** — After validation succeeds:
   1. **Commit** the mapping document to the repository for CI validation.
   2. **Reference in Policies** — this mapping document can be referenced by Layer 3 Policy artifacts.
   3. **Create additional mappings** for other artifact pairs as needed.
   4. Layer 2 schema docs: https://gemara.openssf.org/schema/layer-2.html

## Artifact Type Identification

When the user provides any artifact by URL, file path, or pasted content, confirm its type before deciding how to use it. Do not infer the type from the URL or filename alone.

Procedure:
1. Ask: "What type of Gemara artifact is this?" and present the entry types table from step 1.
2. If the user is unsure, ask for the YAML content, and use the `metadata.type` for definition identification and confirm by calling `validate_gemara_artifact`. Present the results for user final confirmation.
3. If none validate, the artifact may not be Gemara-compatible. Ask the user to clarify and suggest checking for a `metadata` block or consulting the embedded schema documentation.
4. If the artifact is not a Gemara artifact (e.g., NIST 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK), it can still be included as a `mapping-references` entry. Ask the user for the identifier, title, version, URL, and description, and which `entry-type` best describes its atomic units.

## Version Check

After the artifact type is confirmed as a Gemara artifact, check whether it uses the current schema version.

Procedure:
1. Inspect `metadata.gemara-version` in the artifact.
2. If the version equals `"v1.3.0"`, the artifact is current — proceed normally.
3. If the version is older (e.g., `"v1.0.0"`, `"0.20.0"`, `"0.1.0"`, or any value other than `"v1.3.0"`):
   - Inform the user: *"This artifact uses gemara-version `{version}`, which is an older schema version. The current version is v1.3.0."*
   - **If the artifact type is `ThreatCatalog` or `ControlCatalog`:** inform the user that automated migration is available — *"Automated migration to v1.3.0 is available via the **migration** prompt. Would you like to migrate this artifact first, or proceed with the older version as-is?"*
   - **If the artifact type is any other type** (e.g., `GuidanceCatalog`, `CapabilityCatalog`, `VectorCatalog`): warn that automated migration is not yet available — *"Automated migration is not currently available for {type} artifacts. You can still use this artifact as-is in the mapping document."*
   - **If the user chooses to migrate:** direct them to use the `migration` prompt separately with this artifact, then return to the mapping document wizard with the migrated output. Do not attempt to run the migration inline.
   - **If the user declines migration or migration is unavailable:** proceed with the v0 artifact. Record its actual `gemara-version` value in the `mapping-references` entry's `version` field.
4. Regardless of whether the source or target artifacts are v0 or v1, the mapping document's own `metadata.gemara-version` is always `"v1.3.0"`.

## Mapping Document Constraints

- All ID prefix values must match `^[A-Z0-9.-]+$`. If the provided prefix doesn't match, stop and ask for a corrected ID.
- All mapping `id` values within the `mappings` array must be unique.
- When `relationship` is not `no-match`, the `targets` field is required and must contain at least one entry.
- When `relationship` is `no-match`, the `targets` field must be absent.
- The `strength` field, when present, must be an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive.
- The `confidence-level` field, when present, must be one of: `Undetermined`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`.
- The `source-reference` and `target-reference` `reference-id` values must each match an entry in `mapping-references`.
- The mapping document's `metadata.gemara-version` is always `"v1.3.0"`, regardless of the schema versions of the source or target artifacts. The `mapping-references` entries record each referenced artifact's actual version.
- Do not generate or suggest shell commands other than the `cue vet` command in step 5.
