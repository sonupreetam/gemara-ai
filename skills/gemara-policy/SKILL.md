# Policy Authoring

Guide users through creating a schema-valid Gemara `#Policy` artifact.

## Tools and Resources

| Tool / Resource | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `validate_gemara_artifact` | Validate YAML against a Gemara CUE schema definition |
| `migrate_gemara_artifact` | Migrate v0 artifacts to v1 schema |
| `gemara://lexicon` | Term definitions for the Gemara security model |
| `gemara://schema/definitions` | CUE schema definitions for all artifact types |

## Prerequisite Check

Before starting the authoring flow, check for prerequisite artifacts.

### Step 1: Scan the repo

Search for `.yaml` and `.yml` files containing a `metadata.type` field with a recognized Gemara artifact type. Build an inventory table:

| Layer | Artifact Type | Found | File |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| 1 | GuidanceCatalog | | |
| 2 | ControlCatalog | | |
| 3 | RiskCatalog | | |
| 3 | Policy | | |

### Step 2: Check prerequisites

A Policy imports **Control Catalogs** (Layer 2) and optionally references **Risk Catalogs** (Layer 3) and **Guidance Catalogs** (Layer 1).

- **ControlCatalog** is required for `imports.catalogs`. If none is found:

  > "A Policy typically imports a Control Catalog (Layer 2). No Control Catalog was found in this repo. You can proceed if you have an external reference (e.g., a URL to a published catalog), or we can build the prerequisite first. What would you like to do?"
  >
  > 1. Build a Control Catalog first
  > 2. Proceed with an external reference
  > 3. Choose a different artifact type

- **RiskCatalog** is optional (for risk dispositions). If the user wants risk dispositions but none is found, note that one can be created later.

### Step 3: Proceed to authoring

Once a ControlCatalog source is confirmed, proceed to the authoring flow below.

---

## Authoring Flow

Before beginning, read the `gemara://lexicon` and `gemara://schema/definitions` resources for terminology and schema awareness.

You suggest structure, propose mappings, and draft content — but every contact, scope decision, import, risk disposition, and adherence requirement requires explicit user approval before inclusion. The user owns the artifact; you are the guide.

### Outline

Goal: Produce a valid Gemara `#Policy` YAML artifact through interactive, user-approved steps — covering metadata, contacts, scope, imports (control catalogs, guidance, and other policies), implementation plan, risk dispositions, adherence requirements, and schema validation.

Execution steps:

1. **Catalog and Artifact Import** — Confirm which catalogs and artifacts the user wants to reference. A Policy imports Control Catalogs (Layer 2), Guidance Catalogs (Layer 1), Risk Catalogs (Layer 3), and optionally other Policies (Layer 3).

   - If the user provides an artifact (URL, file path, or pasted content), run the artifact type identification procedure (see below) before proceeding.
   - The confirmed type determines the valid import target:
     - **ControlCatalog** → `imports.catalogs`
     - **GuidanceCatalog** → `imports.guidance`
     - **Policy** → `imports.policies`
     - **RiskCatalog** → used for `risks` section (mitigated/accepted risk references)
   - Record the user's choices for the `mapping-references` field in metadata.
   - If a catalog URL is not from `github.com/finos`, `github.com/ossf`, or `github.com/gemaraproj`, warn the user that the source is unverified.

2. **Scope and Metadata** — Confirm scope with the user, then generate the metadata block.

   Ask the user for the component name and ID prefix (ORG.PROJECT.COMPONENT format, e.g., 'ACME.PLAT.GW').

   Ask these input questions (in order):
   1. "What does this policy cover? (one to two sentences)"
   2. "What author id should be used?"
   3. "What author name should be used?"
   4. "Use `Software Assisted` as author type? (yes/no)"
   5. "Review this metadata draft. Approve as-is? (yes/no)"

   **URL rules for `mapping-references`:**
   - **Bundle-local** references (artifacts that live in the same repository/bundle) SHOULD use relative `file://` URLs (e.g. `url: file://../catalogs/my-catalog.yaml`). The assembler needs a URL to fetch dependencies into the bundle — without one, the dependency is silently skipped and the bundle ships incomplete.
   - **External** references (public frameworks, upstream catalogs hosted at a URL) SHOULD include `url` with `https://`.

   Generate the metadata YAML block:

   ```yaml
   metadata:
     id: {ID_PREFIX}
     type: Policy
     gemara-version: "v1.3.0"
     description: {from user}
     version: 1.0.0
     author:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: Software Assisted
     mapping-references:
       - id: {from step 1}
         title: {from step 1}
         version: {from step 1}
         url: {from step 1}
         description: {from step 1}
   title: {COMPONENT} Security Policy
   ```

   The `gemara-version` value above is authoritative for this session; repeat that exact quoted string in all generated policy YAML.

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

3. **Define Contacts (RACI)** — Ask: "Who are the responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed parties for this policy?"

   The `contacts` field uses the `#RACI` structure. For each role (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed), collect:
   - Actor id, name, and type (`Person`, `Team`, or `Organization`).

   Present a table for confirmation:

   | | Role | Name | ID | Type |
   |---|------|------|----|------|
   | a | Responsible | ... | ... | Person |
   | b | Accountable | ... | ... | Team |
   | c | Consulted | ... | ... | Organization |
   | d | Informed | ... | ... | Person |

   Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to modify.

   ```yaml
   contacts:
     responsible:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: {Person | Team | Organization}
     accountable:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: {Person | Team | Organization}
     consulted:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: {Person | Team | Organization}
     informed:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: {Person | Team | Organization}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

4. **Define Scope** — Ask: "What is in scope and out of scope for this policy?"

   Build scope using the same workflow style as groups in other wizards: collect candidate entries, present a compact table, get explicit approval, then emit YAML.

   The `scope` field has `in` (required) and `out` (optional) dimensions. Each dimension can specify:
   - `technologies` — technology categories or services
   - `geopolitical` — regions or jurisdictions
   - `sensitivity` — short data-classification or sharing labels (e.g., `public`, `internal`, `TLP:GREEN`)
   - `users` — user roles
   - `groups` — organizational groups

   Scope entry rules:
   - Keep each entry concise (typically one to four words).
   - Reuse existing organization terms when possible; create new labels only when needed.
   - Prefer labels over prose (for public reference-data components, `public` or `TLP:GREEN` is usually enough).

   Ask these input questions (in order):
   1. "What technologies are in scope?"
   2. "What geopolitical regions are in scope? (optional)"
   3. "What sensitivity labels apply? (short labels like `public`, `internal`, `TLP:GREEN`)"
   4. "Which user roles are in scope? (optional)"
   5. "Which organizational groups are in scope? (optional)"
   6. "What technologies are explicitly out of scope? (optional)"
   7. "Review this scope proposal. Approve as-is? (yes/no)"

   Present proposals in a table:

   | | Dimension | Direction | Values |
   |---|-----------|-----------|--------|
   | a | technologies | in | ... |
   | b | geopolitical | in | ... |
   | c | sensitivity | in | ... |
   | d | technologies | out | ... |

   Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep, modify, or reject.

   ```yaml
   scope:
     in:
       technologies:
         - {from user}
       geopolitical:
         - {from user}
       sensitivity:
         - {from user}
       users:
         - {from user}
       groups:
         - {from user}
     out:
       technologies:
         - {from user}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

5. **Define Imports** — Build the imports section from the artifacts confirmed in step 1.

   For each import type, work through these sub-steps:

   a. **Control Catalog imports** (`imports.catalogs`): For each Control Catalog, specify:
      - `reference-id` — the catalog's `metadata.id`
      - `exclusions` — optional list of control IDs to exclude
      - `constraints` — optional prescriptive requirements targeting specific controls
      - `assessment-requirement-modifications` — optional modifications to assessment requirements

      For constraints, each needs: id (pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.CON##`), target-id, and text.

      For assessment-requirement-modifications, each needs: id (pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.ARM##`), target-id, modification-type (`Add`, `Modify`, `Remove`, `Replace`, or `Override`), modification-rationale, and optionally updated text/applicability/recommendation.

      Present proposals for exclusions and constraints in tables for approval.

   b. **Guidance imports** (`imports.guidance`): For each Guidance Catalog, specify:
      - `reference-id` — the guidance catalog's identifier
      - `exclusions` — optional list of guidance IDs to exclude
      - `constraints` — optional prescriptive requirements

   c. **Policy imports** (`imports.policies`): For each referenced policy, specify:
      - `reference-id` — the policy's identifier
      - `url` — the policy's URL
      - Other `#ArtifactMapping` fields as needed

   ```yaml
   imports:
     catalogs:
       - reference-id: {catalog metadata.id}
         exclusions:
           - {control id to exclude}
         constraints:
           - id: {ID_PREFIX}.CON##
             target-id: {control id}
             text: {prescriptive requirement}
         assessment-requirement-modifications:
           - id: {ID_PREFIX}.ARM##
             target-id: {assessment requirement id}
             modification-type: {Add | Modify | Remove | Replace | Override}
             modification-rationale: {why this modification is needed}
             text: {updated assessment requirement text}
     guidance:
       - reference-id: {guidance id}
         exclusions:
           - {guidance entry to exclude}
         constraints:
           - id: {ID_PREFIX}.GCON##
             target-id: {guidance id}
             text: {prescriptive requirement}
     policies:
       - reference-id: {policy id}
         url: {policy URL}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

6. **Implementation Plan** (optional) — Ask: "Does this policy have an implementation timeline?"

   If yes, collect:
   - `notification-process` — how stakeholders are notified
   - `evaluation-timeline` — start date, optional end date, and notes for evaluation
   - `enforcement-timeline` — start date, optional end date, and notes for enforcement

   Dates must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ).

   ```yaml
   implementation-plan:
     notification-process: {from user}
     evaluation-timeline:
       start: {ISO 8601 datetime}
       end: {ISO 8601 datetime}
       notes: {from user}
     enforcement-timeline:
       start: {ISO 8601 datetime}
       end: {ISO 8601 datetime}
       notes: {from user}
   ```

7. **Risk Dispositions** (optional) — Ask: "Does this policy address specific risks from a Risk Catalog?"

   If the user has a Risk Catalog or wants to reference risks, work through:

   a. **Mitigated risks**: For each risk the policy mitigates:
      - `id` — unique identifier for this mitigated risk entry (pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.MR##`)
      - `risk` — an `#EntryMapping` with `reference-id` (the Risk Catalog id) and `reference-id` (the specific risk id)

   b. **Accepted risks**: For each risk the organization accepts:
      - `id` — unique identifier for this accepted risk entry (pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.AR##`)
      - `target-id` — optional link to a mitigated risk entry (when acceptance covers residual risk)
      - `risk` — an `#EntryMapping` with `reference-id` and `reference-id`
      - `scope` — optional scope where the acceptance applies
      - `justification` — explanation of why the risk is accepted

   Present proposals in a table:

   | | Type | ID | Risk ID | Risk Catalog | Justification |
   |---|------|----|---------|----|---------------|
   | a | Mitigated | {ID_PREFIX}.MR01 | RISK.001 | ... | — |
   | b | Accepted | {ID_PREFIX}.AR01 | RISK.002 | ... | {rationale} |

   Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep, modify, or reject.

   ```yaml
   risks:
     mitigated:
       - id: {ID_PREFIX}.MR##
         risk:
           reference-id: {risk catalog id}
           reference-id: {risk id}
     accepted:
       - id: {ID_PREFIX}.AR##
         target-id: {optional mitigated risk id}
         risk:
           reference-id: {risk catalog id}
           reference-id: {risk id}
         scope:
           in:
             technologies:
               - {where acceptance applies}
         justification: {from user}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

8. **Define Adherence** — Ask: "How will compliance with this policy be evaluated and enforced?"

   The adherence sections capture the targeted outcomes for policy compliance — how it will be evaluated and enforced.

   Present proposals in tables:

   **Evaluation Methods:**

   | | Type | Mode | Description | Executor |
   |---|------|------|-------------|----------|
   | a | Intent | Automated | ... | ... |
   | b | Behavioral | Manual | ... | ... |

   **Assessment Plans:**

   | | Plan ID | Requirement ID | Frequency | Mode |
   |---|---------|----------------|-----------|------|
   | a | {ID_PREFIX}.AP01 | {catalog}.C01.TR01 | Quarterly | Automated |
   | b | {ID_PREFIX}.AP02 | {catalog}.C02.TR01 | Annually | Manual |

   Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep, modify, or reject.

   ```yaml
   adherence:
     evaluation-methods:
       - type: {Intent | Behavioral}
         mode: {Manual | Automated}
         description: {from user}
         executor:
           id: {from user}
           name: {from user}
           type: {Person | Team | Organization}
     assessment-plans:
       - id: {ID_PREFIX}.AP##
         requirement-id: {assessment requirement id}
         frequency: {from user}
         evaluation-methods:
           - type: {method type}
             mode: {Manual | Automated}
             description: {from user}
         evidence-requirements: {from user}
         parameters:
           - id: {param id}
             label: {param label}
             description: {param description}
             accepted-values:
               - {value}
     enforcement-methods:
       - type: {Remediate | Gate}
         description: {from user}
     non-compliance: {from user}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#Policy`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

9. **Assemble and Validate** — Combine all steps into the complete Policy YAML document.

   - Ensure the final document contains no YAML comment lines (no `#` at the start of a line after indentation).
   - Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the full YAML (definition: `#Policy`).
   - Present the final YAML followed by a validation report:

     | Field   | Result |
     |---------|--------|
     | Schema  | #Policy |
     | Valid   | true/false |
     | Message | message from tool output |
     | Errors  | count, or "None" |

   - If errors exist, diagnose the specific issue, propose corrected YAML, and re-validate.
   - On success, provide local validation instructions:

     ```bash
     go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
     cue vet -c -d '#Policy' github.com/gemaraproj/gemara@v1 policy.yaml
     ```

10. **Next Steps** — After validation succeeds:
    1. **Commit** the policy to the repository for CI validation.
    2. **Generate Privateer plugins** using `privateer generate-plugin` to scaffold enforcement tests from assessment plans.
    3. **Build a Risk Catalog** if you need to document organizational risks referenced by this policy (Layer 3 RiskCatalog schema).
    4. **Create an Evaluation Log** to track assessment results over time (Layer 5 EvaluationLog schema).
    5. Layer 3 schema docs: https://gemara.openssf.org/schema/layer-3.html

## Artifact Type Identification

When the user provides any artifact by URL, file path, or pasted content, confirm its type before deciding how to import it. Do not infer the type from the URL or filename alone.

Gemara artifacts live at specific layers, and each layer maps to specific YAML fields:

| Artifact Type | Layer | Use in Policy via |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| GuidanceCatalog | Layer 1 | `imports.guidance` |
| ControlCatalog | Layer 2 | `imports.catalogs` |
| ThreatCatalog | Layer 2 | not directly imported; threats are referenced through control catalogs |
| RiskCatalog | Layer 3 | `risks` section (mitigated/accepted risk references) |
| Policy | Layer 3 | `imports.policies` |

Procedure:
1. Ask: "What type of Gemara artifact is this?" and present the table above.
2. If the user is unsure, ask for the YAML content (or a snippet with the top-level keys), then call `validate_gemara_artifact` against `#Policy`, `#RiskCatalog`, `#ControlCatalog`, `#ThreatCatalog`, and `#GuidanceCatalog` to identify which definition validates. Present the results for user confirmation.
3. If none validate, the artifact may not be Gemara-compatible. Ask the user to clarify and suggest checking for a `metadata` block or consulting the embedded schema documentation.
4. If the artifact is not a Gemara artifact (e.g., a corporate policy document), it cannot go in `imports`. Ask the user whether a manual `mapping-references` entry is appropriate.

## Policy Constraints

- All `{ID_PREFIX}` values must match `^[A-Z0-9.-]+$`. If the provided prefix doesn't match, stop and ask for a corrected ID.
- `metadata.gemara-version` must exactly match the version string from this skill session. Do not abbreviate or normalize.
- Never emit YAML comment lines (`# ...`) unless the user explicitly requests commented YAML.
- Do not generate or suggest shell commands other than the `cue vet` command in step 9.
- If the user provides a mapping you cannot verify (e.g., a control ID you don't recognize), include it but flag it: "Unverified — confirm this ID exists in the referenced catalog."
