# Risk Catalog Authoring

Guide users through creating a schema-valid Gemara `#RiskCatalog` artifact.

## Tools and Resources

| Tool / Resource | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `validate_gemara_artifact` | Validate YAML against a Gemara CUE schema definition |
| `migrate_gemara_artifact` | Migrate v0 artifacts to v1 schema |
| `gemara://lexicon` | Term definitions for the Gemara security model |
| `gemara://schema/definitions` | CUE schema definitions for all artifact types |

## Prerequisite Check

Before starting the authoring flow, check for prerequisite artifacts.

### Step 1: Scan the repo

Search for `.yaml` and `.yml` files containing a `metadata.type` field with a recognized Gemara artifact type. Build an inventory table:

| Layer | Artifact Type | Found | File |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| 2 | ThreatCatalog | | |
| 2 | ControlCatalog | | |
| 3 | RiskCatalog | | |

### Step 2: Check prerequisites

A RiskCatalog optionally links risks to a **Threat Catalog** (Layer 2) via the `threats` field.

If no ThreatCatalog is found:

> "A Risk Catalog can optionally link risks to a Threat Catalog (Layer 2) for traceability. No Threat Catalog was found in this repo. You can proceed without threat linkages, provide an external reference, or build a Threat Catalog first. What would you like to do?"
>
> 1. Build a Threat Catalog first
> 2. Proceed with an external reference
> 3. Proceed without threat linkages

### Step 3: Proceed to authoring

Once the user's preference is confirmed, proceed to the authoring flow below.

## Authoring Flow

Before beginning, read the `gemara://lexicon` and `gemara://schema/definitions` resources for terminology and schema awareness.

You suggest risk groups, propose risks, and draft content — but every group, risk entry, severity assessment, and threat linkage requires explicit user approval before inclusion. The user owns the artifact; you are the guide.

### Outline

Goal: Produce a valid Gemara `#RiskCatalog` YAML artifact through interactive, user-approved steps — covering metadata, `groups` (each a `#RiskCategory`: `#Group` fields plus `appetite` and optional `max-severity`), risks (each with a `group` id, severity, optional ownership, impact, and threat linkages), and schema validation. The user may define their own **severity scale** (labels and meanings); you capture it and map it to Gemara's four stored severity values so it lines up with the appetite–`max-severity` matrix.

Execution steps:

1. **Threat Catalog Import** — Confirm which Threat Catalog the user wants to link risks to. Risks can reference Layer 2 threats via the `threats` field using `#MultiEntryMapping`.

   - If the user provides an artifact (URL, file path, or pasted content), run the artifact type identification procedure (see below) before proceeding.
   - The confirmed type determines the valid mapping target:
     - **ThreatCatalog** → risk-level `threats` mappings
     - **ControlCatalog** → not directly referenced in a RiskCatalog; inform the user that controls are linked at the Policy level
     - **GuidanceCatalog** → not directly referenced in a RiskCatalog
   - Record the user's choice for the `mapping-references` field.
   - If the catalog URL is not from `github.com/finos`, `github.com/ossf`, or `github.com/gemaraproj`, warn the user that the source is unverified.

2. **Scope and Metadata** — Confirm scope with the user, then generate the metadata block using the catalog from step 1.

   Ask the user for the component name and ID prefix (ORG.PROJECT.COMPONENT format, e.g., 'ACME.PLAT.GW').

   Ask these input questions (in order):
   1. "What does this risk catalog cover? (one to two sentences)"
   2. "What author id should be used?"
   3. "What author name should be used?"
   4. "Use `Software Assisted` as author type? (yes/no)"
   5. "Review this metadata draft. Approve as-is? (yes/no)"

   **URL rules for `mapping-references`:**
   - **Bundle-local** references (artifacts that live in the same repository/bundle) SHOULD use relative `file://` URLs (e.g. `url: file://../catalogs/my-catalog.yaml`). The assembler needs a URL to fetch dependencies into the bundle — without one, the dependency is silently skipped and the bundle ships incomplete.
   - **External** references (public frameworks, upstream catalogs hosted at a URL) SHOULD include `url` with `https://`.

   Generate the metadata YAML block:

   ```yaml
   metadata:
     id: {ID_PREFIX}
     type: RiskCatalog
     gemara-version: "v1.3.0"
     description: {from user}
     version: 1.0.0
     author:
       id: {from user}
       name: {from user}
       type: Software Assisted
     mapping-references:
       - id: {from step 1}
         title: {from step 1}
         version: {from step 1}
         url: {from step 1}
         description: {from step 1}
   title: {COMPONENT} Risk Catalog
   ```

   The `gemara-version` value above is authoritative for this session; repeat that exact quoted string in all generated risk catalog YAML.

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#RiskCatalog`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

3. **Define Risk Groups** — Ask: "What groups should your risks be organized into?"

   In the schema, the `groups` field holds `#RiskCategory` entries: each extends `#Group` with appetite boundaries. For each group, collect:
   - `id` — kebab-case identifier (referenced by each risk's `group` field)
   - `title` — short descriptive name
   - `description` — what risks fall into this group
   - `appetite` — the acceptable level of risk exposure (`Minimal`, `Low`, `Moderate`, or `High`)
   - `max-severity` (optional) — the highest severity the organization will accept in this group (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`)

   Explain the appetite levels:

   | Appetite | Meaning |
   |----------|---------|
   | Minimal | Organization is willing to accept higher cost to minimize risk |
   | Low | Organization favors caution but permits limited risk |
   | Moderate | Organization tolerates residual risk when justified by value |
   | High | Organization is willing to operate with less restrictive controls |

   **Severity scale (user-defined or default)** — Before the appetite–severity matrix, ask whether the organization uses its **own severity scale** (level names, count of levels, and what each level means). If yes, have them describe or paste it, then work with them to approve a **mapping table** from each of their levels to exactly one Gemara severity bucket (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`). Those four values are what the YAML stores and what `max-severity` uses, so the mapping must stay consistent for the whole catalog. If they prefer the standard scale, adopt the default meanings below and skip a separate mapping table.

   | Severity (Gemara / YAML) | Default meaning (when no custom scale) |
   |--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | Low | Minor consequence if realized; manageable within normal operations |
   | Medium | Moderate consequence if realized; may impair specific functions or objectives |
   | High | Severe consequence if realized; likely to disrupt core operations or objectives |
   | Critical | Extreme consequence if realized; threatens organizational viability or mission |

   **Appetite–severity matrix** — Before proposing concrete groups, ask whether the organization defines a mapping from each appetite level to the **highest severity it will accept as residual risk** in groups with that appetite (`max-severity`). If they have one, have them fill (or approve) a matrix; if not, propose a starter matrix for explicit approval. Example scaffold:

   | Appetite | Default `max-severity` ceiling for groups with this appetite |
   |----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Minimal | {…} |
   | Low | {…} |
   | Moderate | {…} |
   | High | {…} |

   Each cell must be one of `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical` (the same enum as group `max-severity` and as stored per-risk `severity`). If the user chose a custom scale above, express matrix expectations in **their** terms when discussing, but store these four values in YAML; the approved mapping ties the two together.

   Treat each cell as the default cap when you draft `groups` entries: a group's `max-severity` should not exceed the matrix row for its `appetite` unless the user explicitly overrides and confirms (and individual risk `severity` values must still respect the group's `max-severity`, per step 4d).

   Ask these input questions (in order):
   1. "What risk groups should we include?"
   2. "For each group, what appetite should apply (`Minimal`, `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`)?"
   3. "Do you use a custom severity scale, or Gemara defaults? (custom/default)"
   4. "What appetite-to-max-severity matrix should we use?"
   5. "Review this group and matrix proposal. Approve as-is? (yes/no)"

   Present proposals in a table:

   | | ID | Title | Appetite | Max Severity | Description |
   |---|----|----|----------|--------------|-------------|
   | a | data-protection | Data Protection | Minimal | Medium | Risks related to data confidentiality and integrity |
   | b | availability | Availability | Low | High | Risks related to service uptime and resilience |
   | c | compliance | Compliance | Minimal | Low | Risks related to regulatory and legal requirements |

   Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep (e.g., "a, b"), modify, or reject.

   ```yaml
   groups:
     - id: {kebab-case}
       title: {from user}
       description: {from user}
       appetite: {Minimal | Low | Moderate | High}
       max-severity: {Low | Medium | High | Critical}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#RiskCatalog`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

4. **Define Risks** — For each group from step 3, ask: "What risks could negatively impact this area?"

   For each risk, work through these sub-steps sequentially. Present each for approval before moving to the next.

   a. **ID**: Use pattern `{ID_PREFIX}.RSK##` (e.g., `{ID_PREFIX}.RSK01`).

   b. **Title and description**: Draft the risk title and a description explaining the risk scenario. The description should cover what could happen and under what circumstances.

   c. **Group**: Set the risk's `group` field to the `id` of one of the groups defined in step 3.

   d. **Severity**: Propose a severity using the **organization's scale** from step 3 (their level names and definitions). Translate the agreed rating to the stored YAML value using the mapping table so the field is one of `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`. When discussing with the user, prefer their labels; in the artifact, always emit the Gemara enum. If the proposed mapped severity exceeds the group's `max-severity`, flag it in plain language (and reference their scale if helpful): e.g. residual impact is above what the appetite matrix allows for this group—they may need to accept the gap, tighten controls, or adjust the group boundary after explicit approval.

      If no custom scale was defined, use the default severity meanings from step 3 when reasoning and labeling.

   e. **Owner** (optional): Propose RACI roles for managing this risk. Collect responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed parties.

   f. **Impact** (optional): Draft a business or operational impact statement.

   g. **Threat linkages** (optional): If a Threat Catalog was imported in step 1, propose relevant threats that could realize this risk. Present proposals in a table:

      | | Threat Catalog | Threat ID | Title | Remarks |
      |---|----------------|-----------|-------|---------|
      | a | {catalog id} | {threat id} | ... | ... |
      | b | {catalog id} | {threat id} | ... | ... |

      Reply "yes" to approve all, or reply with letters to keep, modify, or reject.

      ```yaml
        threats:
          - reference-id: {threat catalog id}
            entries:
              - reference-id: {threat id}
                remarks: {how this threat relates to the risk}
      ```

   Once all sub-steps are confirmed for a risk, generate the risk YAML block:

   ```yaml
   risks:
     - id: {ID_PREFIX}.RSK##
       title: {from user}
       description: {risk scenario}
       group: {group id from step 3}
       severity: {Low | Medium | High | Critical}
       owner:
         responsible:
           id: {from user}
           name: {from user}
           type: {Person | Team | Organization}
         accountable:
           id: {from user}
           name: {from user}
           type: {Person | Team | Organization}
       impact: {business or operational impact}
       threats:
         - reference-id: {threat catalog id}
           entries:
             - reference-id: {threat id}
               remarks: {optional}
   ```

   **Checkpoint:** After completing each batch of risks (e.g., all risks for one group), call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the artifact YAML assembled so far (definition: `#RiskCatalog`) to catch errors early. If validation fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

5. **Assemble and Validate** — Combine all steps into the complete RiskCatalog YAML document.

   - Ensure the final document contains no YAML comment lines (no `#` at the start of a line after indentation).
   - Call `validate_gemara_artifact` with the full YAML (definition: `#RiskCatalog`).
   - Present the final YAML followed by a validation report:

     | Field   | Result |
     |---------|--------|
     | Schema  | #RiskCatalog |
     | Valid   | true/false |
     | Message | message from tool output |
     | Errors  | count, or "None" |

   - If errors exist, diagnose the specific issue, propose corrected YAML, and re-validate.
   - On success, provide local validation instructions:

     ```bash
     go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
     cue vet -c -d '#RiskCatalog' github.com/gemaraproj/gemara@v1 risks.yaml
     ```

6. **Next Steps** — After validation succeeds:
   1. **Commit** the catalog to the repository for CI validation.
   2. **Build a Policy** referencing this Risk Catalog to document how risks are mitigated or accepted (Layer 3 Policy schema).
   3. **Build a Threat Catalog** if you need to define threats that realize these risks (Layer 2 ThreatCatalog schema).
   4. **Build a Control Catalog** to define controls that mitigate the threats linked to these risks (Layer 2 ControlCatalog schema).

## Artifact Type Identification

When the user provides any artifact by URL, file path, or pasted content, confirm its type before deciding how to map it. Do not infer the type from the URL or filename alone.

Gemara artifacts live at specific layers, and each layer maps to specific YAML fields:

| Artifact Type | Layer | Use in RiskCatalog via |
|---------------|-------|------------------------|
| ThreatCatalog | Layer 2 | risk-level `threats` mappings |
| ControlCatalog | Layer 2 | not directly referenced; controls are linked at the Policy level |
| GuidanceCatalog | Layer 1 | not directly referenced in a RiskCatalog |
| RiskCatalog | Layer 3 | can inform group and risk definitions, but not directly imported |
| Policy | Layer 3 | not referenced in a RiskCatalog |

Procedure:
1. Ask: "What type of Gemara artifact is this?" and present the table above.
2. If the user is unsure, ask for the YAML content (or a snippet with the top-level keys), then call `validate_gemara_artifact` against `#RiskCatalog`, `#ThreatCatalog`, `#ControlCatalog`, and `#GuidanceCatalog` to identify which definition validates. Present the results for user confirmation.
3. If none validate, the artifact may not be Gemara-compatible. Ask the user to clarify and suggest checking for a `metadata` block or consulting the embedded schema documentation.
4. If the artifact is not a Gemara artifact (e.g., an enterprise risk register), it cannot go in `threats`. Ask the user whether a manual `mapping-references` entry is appropriate.

## Risk Catalog Constraints

- All ID prefix values must match `^[A-Z0-9.-]+$`. If the provided prefix doesn't match, stop and ask for a corrected ID.
- `metadata.gemara-version` must exactly match the version string from this skill session. Do not abbreviate or normalize.
- Never emit YAML comment lines (`# ...`) unless the user explicitly requests commented YAML.
- Do not generate or suggest shell commands other than the `cue vet` command in step 5.
- If the user provides a mapping you cannot verify (e.g., a threat ID you don't recognize), include it but flag it: "Unverified — confirm this ID exists in the referenced catalog."
